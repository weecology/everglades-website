We use airplanes, drones, field work, and computer vision to monitor the timing, distribution, and outcomes of nesting.

All data from the Wading Bird Project are made openly available in near real-time so that they can provide the maximum benefit to scientific research and outreach. The core dataset is managed using an [automated living data workflow](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000125) run using GitHub and Continuous Analysis.
